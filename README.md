# dag-cbrrr
Convert between DAG-CBOR and Python objects and hundreds of megabytes per second.

Other than speed, a distinguishing feature is that it operates *non-recursively*. This means you can parse arbitrarily deeply nested objects without running out of call stack (although of course you might still run out of heap)

## Status: UNSAFE/UNSTABLE/EXPERIMENTAL/WIP

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/dag-cbrrr
cd dag-cbrrr
python3 -m pip install -v .
```

### Quickstart

Here's the basics.
```py
import cbrrr

encoded = cbrrr.encode_dag_cbor({"hello": [b"world", 1, 2, 3]})
print(encoded)  # b'\xa1ehello\x84Eworld\x01\x02\x03'
decoded = cbrrr.decode_dag_cbor(encoded)
print(decoded)  # {'hello': [b'world', 1, 2, 3]}
```
